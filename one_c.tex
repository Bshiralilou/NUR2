\section{(1.c)}

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is constructed as a statistical hypothesis test.
We determine a null hypothesis, D, that our sample matches a given distribution.
Then we search for evidence whether this hypothesis is correct and express this in terms of a probability.
If the likelihood of the sample being from this distribution exceeds a confidence level (usually 0.05), we say that the data matches the distribution.

As can be seen from this test, the random data points match the normal distribution very accurately. 
However, when compared to scipy KS test, the behaviour is very random!!!! 
In order to investigate the issue, I made the same plots using the random numbers generated by python package BUT the overal behaviour did not change.
