\section{(1.b)}
Using the Box-Muller method, we can generate two sets of normal-distributed random numbers, here defined as z1 and z2.\\
As shown in Fig. 4, the generated data points match the gaussian distribution with good accuracy.\\
The histogram is normalized to one and the orange line shows the normal distribution from scipy package.\\
NOTE: Although the generated random numbers are within 0 and 1, in this section 
I saw that sometimes logarithm of the random values are positive,
which either means that the random generator is giving value bigger than 1, or the logarithm is doing something strange!
